"""
The Poisson Process is the model we use for describing randomly occurring events and by itself, isnâ€™t that useful. 

Using the Poisson Distribution, we can find the probability of a number of events in a time period or finding the probability of waiting some time until the next event.

The Poisson Distribution probability mass function gives the probability of observing k events in a time period given the length of the period and the average events per time:

\begin{equation}
P (k \ events \ in \ interval) = exp ( -\lambda )\frac{\lambda^k}{k!}
\end{equation}
